2. Create a Map on the Seat Map Maker Site [Seat Map Maker Site](https://wsuvcapstoneteam7.github.io/SeatMapMaker/)
3. Download the Map.
4. Copy downloaded map data into the directory `SeatMapViewer/seat-map.json`, over writing any pre existing data.
6. Host the Seat Map Viewer instance using your own server.
