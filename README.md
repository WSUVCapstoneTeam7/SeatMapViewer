[Release: Version 1](https://github.com/WSUVCapstoneTeam7/SeatMapMaker/releases/latest)

## Description:
Seat Map Viewer loads JSON data from a file named `seat-map.json`. The file seat-map.json can be generated and downloaded using the Seat Map Maker tool. Seats which can be purchased display a pop-up menu with purchase options when clicked. When a user purchases a seat the seat will change color to red and no longer selectable. 

## Usage:
1. Clone [Seat Map Viewer Repository](https://github.com/WSUVCapstoneTeam7/SeatMapMaker).
2. Create a Map on the Seat Map Maker Site [Seat Map Maker Site](https://wsuvcapstoneteam7.github.io/SeatMapMaker/)
3. Download the Map.
4. Copy downloaded map data into the directory `SeatMapViewer/seat-map.json`, overwriting any pre-existing data.
6. Host the Seat Map Viewer instance using your own server.
* Alternatively with an application like [Live Server for VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)
